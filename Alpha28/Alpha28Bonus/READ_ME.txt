Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.
The configuration settings for this mod are located at:

https://github.com/SoftMonster/KeeperRLMods

The rights you have regarding this software configuration is found in COPYING.txt

This mod is expected to be available in-game as a download.
The in-game version will also contain any new graphic tiles that are required.

Graphics tiles are not included on Github because some of the tiles have been modified
from tiles that are already licensed elsewhere. The tiles must be downloaded in-game and
are not necessarily distributable outside specific conditions.

Thanks for your understanding.

Enjoy the mod!

Soft Monster
